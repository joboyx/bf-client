# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [BunnyFap Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [info@bunnyfap.com](mailto:info@bunnyfap.com).

# How can I contribute?

Bunnyfap is an open source project and we love receiving input and contributions from our community! There are many different ways you can contribute, and not all of them require you to be a code wizard. For example, you can contribute by writing tutorials, improving documentation, sumitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into Bunnyfap itself. 

## Reporting a bug
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [info@bunnyfap.com](info@bunnyfap.com) instead.
<!-- > In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just shoot us an [email](info@bunnyfap.com). -->

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Bunnyfap. Following these guidelines helps contributors and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [the list below](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible and fill out the required template; this information helps us resolve issues faster.

> Note: If you find a Closed issue which still seems unresolved, open a new issue and include the link to the original issue in the body.


### Before Submitting A Bug Report
* **Check the current [list of issues](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). You can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/issues/new/choose), and fill out [the bug report template](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Assign** the issue to the project team which you think is most suitable to tackle the issue. 
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* ** If relevant, include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

## Your first contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Bunnyfap? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### New to open source projects?
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials which will help you out: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com.

## Code review process
The core team looks at [Pull Requests](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/pulls) on a regular basis, which are discussed on the Discord server. After feedback has been given to pull requests we expect responses within four weeks. After fourt weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# I wanna start coding
Make sure to go through the [README.md](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client) for installation instructions as well.

   ```
2. Once you have added the feature you are working on, commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'
   ```
3. Then, push the changes your forked repo:
   ```sh
     git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
   ```
4. Lastly, [create a pull request](https://github.com/bunnyfap/client/pulls) to merge your code to the original repo!
