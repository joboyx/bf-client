<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) --->

BunnyFap is an adult website which learns your preferences and delivers you the content you love. We launched in 2019 with the vision to create a beautiful and intuitive platform for the community, without harassing users with ads or monetisation. 

### Built With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Vuetify v1.5](https://v15.vuetifyjs.com/en)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following packages before you can get started:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

<!--- * npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
--->

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bunnyfap/client.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the dev client on localhost port 3000
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
After running the client, it will automatically update when you make changes to the code. Keep in mind that it has to rebuild entirely every time you change something. 

### Server connection
At the moment, the Bunnyfap server is not open source, and therefore you will not be able to run your own instance yet. We are currently in the process of open sourcing it. For the momemt, you will have to connect directly to the main server, while we are still working on deploying a test server. The client will connect to the production server by default. 

### Documentation
Documentation is written using [Vuese](https://vuese.org/) and can be viewed by running the following command:
   ```sh
   vuese serve --open
   ```
See the [Vuese documentation](https://vuese.org/cli/#quick-start) for more information about Vuese.

Admittedly, the documentation is still a bit rought around the edges. If anything is unclear, do feel free to reach out to the developers. We do aim to polish the documentation in the future. 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
